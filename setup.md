# Setup

Getting started is easy. To get up and running quickly we suggest you begin by running the simulation environment using the [prebuilt binaries](#prebuilt-binaries) for your platform.


## Requirements

We develop and test on [Ubuntu 18.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) with Python 3.

You'll also need a working [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) workspace. We provide an optional [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration to run ROS.

## Installation

### Unity

### ROS

  - Setup a [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) or use the [Docker Compose](#Docker Compose) configuration
