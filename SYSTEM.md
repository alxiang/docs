# Social Navigation Simulation Platform

The social navigation simulation platform is a high fidelity, extensible, and open source simulation environment designed for the fair evaluation of social navigation algorithms. It leverages advances in graphics and physics modeling to build high fidelity scenes. We include in the platform many scenes with social agents that navigate according to standard pedestrian models. Integration with the Robot Operating System (ROS) allows for compatibility with existing navigation software stacks.
